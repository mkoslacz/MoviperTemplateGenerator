# [Moviper](https://github.com/mkoslacz/Moviper) Template Generator

### Templates generator for [Moviper](https://github.com/mkoslacz/Moviper) - [Mosby](https://github.com/mkoslacz/Moviper) based [VIPER](https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper/) library for Android

## Where to get Moviper?

Read more [here](https://github.com/mkoslacz/Moviper).

## What does this generator do?

It generates appropriate file set to quickly create Moviper Viper managed Activity or Fragment.

## Installation

To use these templates you will need Android Studio.

Copy the folders from `resources/liveTemplates` into `<androidStudio-folder>/plugins/android/lib/templates/other/` and they will appear in the project explorer context menu.

Restart Android Studio, and you will find templates in: `New -> Other -> Moviper Viper managed Activity / Fragment`. Use the right click in location where you want your Activity/Fragment to be created.

## Why is it bundled as a InteliJ Plugin?

Because it's the easiest way for me to manage these templates and hopefully, in future, they will be distributed as a Android Studio plugin, what will allow a much easier installation and migrating between Android Studio versions.

## Known issues

- Generated Activity isn't added to `AndroidManifest.xml`.
- There is no possibility to generate other Moviper Fragments and Activities than Viper ones (Wipe and Perv are also available in the library).
- A copy-paste installation is kinda problematic.
- The copy-paste installation will not migrate with Android Studio updates.
- If you name your Activity or Fragment in non conventional way, weird stuff happens.
